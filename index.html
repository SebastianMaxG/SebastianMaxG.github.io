        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm a third-year Game Development student at Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE). My passion lies in gameplay and tool programming, where I enjoy blending creativity with technical expertise. I am particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of gaming by integrating innovative technologies and engineering principles into my projects.

            On this site, you'll find a collection of my work, showcasing my skills in engine development, tool programming, and problem-solving. I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me to grow and make a meaningful impact in the gaming world. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch!

                <h3>Rage In The Office</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a group project with a team of 2 programmers and 2 artists, me being one of the 2 programmers.
                    One of the main challenges at the start of the project is that we wanted to have the objects shatter from damage aplied to them.
                    however, we had no idea how to do this. After some research, we found out that we could use the chaos physics system in Unreal Engine 5.
                    this is a beta feature and didn't have much documentation on it as well as the fact that it isn't made for games.
                    To solve this we used a basic system where we would spawn a the chaos object in the place of the old one when it got destoyed since chaos objects didn't allow for dynamic movement.
                    Built using Unreal/C++.

                <h3>Game Engine + Bomberman NES</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a project where I made a game engine from scratch in C++ and then made a Bomberman NES clone using that engine.
                    The engine was made using the SDL2 library and the game was made using the engine.
                    I made a basic entity-component system as well as a basic collision system.
                    The system I am most proud of is the event system that is based on the signal/slot pattern taking inspiration from GODOT.
                    It allows for easy communication between objects in the game since it calls functions and not objects as well as being fully templatable.  
                    The Game itself is a simple Bomberman clone with a single player mode and a multiplayer mode with only 5 levels.
                    It has animations, sound, and a basic AI.
                    Built using purely C++ and SDL libraries.
