        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="preserve-whitespace">
            Hi, I'm a third-year Game Development student at Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE).
            My passion lies in gameplay and tool programming, where I enjoy blending creativity with technical expertise.
            I am particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of gaming by integrating innovative technologies and engineering principles into my projects.

            On this site, you'll find a collection of my work, showcasing my skills in engine development, tool programming, and problem-solving.
            I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me to grow and make a meaningful impact in the gaming world.
            Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch!
        </p>

                <h3>Rage In The Office</h3>
                <p class="preserve-whitespace">
                    This was a group project with a team of 2 programmers and 2 artists, me being one of the 2 programmers.
                    One of the main challenges at the start of the project is that we wanted to have the objects shatter from damage aplied to them.
                    however, we had no idea how to do this. After some research, we found out that we could use the chaos physics system in Unreal Engine 5.
                    this is a beta feature and didn't have much documentation on it as well as the fact that it isn't made for games.
                    To solve this we used a basic system where we would spawn a the chaos object in the place of the old one when it got destoyed since chaos objects didn't allow for dynamic movement.
                    Built using Unreal/C++.

                <h3>Game Engine + Bomberman NES</h3>
                <p class="preserve-whitespace">
                    This is a project where I made a game engine from scratch in C++ and then made a Bomberman NES clone using that engine.
                    The engine was made using the SDL2 library and the game was made using the engine.
                    I made a basic entity-component system as well as a basic collision system.
                    The system I am most proud of is the event system that is based on the signal/slot pattern taking inspiration from GODOT.
                    It allows for easy communication between objects in the game since it calls functions and not objects as well as being fully templatable.
                    The Game itself is a simple Bomberman clone with a single player mode and a multiplayer mode with only 5 levels.
                    It has animations, sound, and a basic AI.
                    Built using purely C++ and SDL libraries.

                <h3>Formation Movement Research</h3>
                <p class="preserve-whitespace">
                    In this project, I researched how to make a formation movement system for a game.
                    This was also my first time making an almost fully c++ unreal project.
                    The project allows you to select a group of units and then move them around in a formation.
                    You can specify the formation as well as rotation and the units will move to the correct position in the formation.
                    The project makes use of the Unreal Engine's AI system to move the units. to the specified position.
                    This was a challinging project at the time but I learned a lot from it.
                    It also comes with a simple RTS camera system as well as a research document.
                    Built using Unreal/C++.

                <h3>Poseidon's Moving Company</h3>
                <p class="preserve-whitespace">
                    This is a GameJam project where we had to make a game in 2 and a half days.
                    The theme of the game jam was "Keep it moving".
                    We decided to make a game where you play as a moving company that makes use of sharks.
                    The reason for this is because sharks never stop moving.
                    The game is a 2D game where you have to pick up boxes and furniture and bring them to the moving van.
                    The twist is that you have to do this while avoiding the walls because you shoudn't damage the furnature.
                    We worked in a team of 6 people, 2 artists, 3 programmers, and 1 sound designer.
                    The game was made in Godot and also my first time using this engine.

                <h3>Vulcan + Bullet Physics Visualizer</h3>
                <p class="preserve-whitespace">
                    This is a project where I made a visualizer for the Bullet Physics engine.
                    The visualizer is made using the Vulcan graphics API.
                    It is able to show the physics objects in the scene as well as their acceleration and velocity vectors.
                    The project is made using the Bullet Physics engine and the Vulcan graphics API making use of CMake to build the project.
                    The project gave me insight on implementing different libraries and how to use them together.
                    While making this project I wanted every model to have accurate collision so it includes a remesher for concave objects.
                    Built using CMake/C++.
